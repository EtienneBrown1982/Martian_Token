The error occurred because the visibility specifier "public" is specified twice in the constructor declaration of the KaseiCoinCrowdsale contract. 

To fix the error, remove the second "public" keyword from the constructor declaration so that it only appears once. The corrected code should be:

```
constructor(
        uint rate,
        address payable wallet,
        KaseiCoin token
        
    ) public Crowdsale(rate, wallet, token) {
        // constructor can stay empty
    }
```

The error occurred because the Solidity compiler was unable to find the file "KaseiCoin.sol" in the specified directory "./KaseiCoin.sol". 

To fix this error, you need to ensure that the file "KaseiCoin.sol" is in the correct directory and that the path specified in the import statement is correct. Make sure that the file is in the same directory as the contract that is importing it, or update the import statement to specify the correct path to the file.
